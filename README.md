# Bank_Marketing_Prediction

This is a binary classification problem using the Bank Marketing dataset from the article "Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology" [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing]. There are 4,517 observations with 17 input variables including age, job, balance,  and marital status; the output variable confirms whether a customer subscribed to the banking product or not. 

I will walk through loading the dataset, data-cleaning, and exploratory data analysis will be conducted and insights about the bank customer base will be provided with visualizations in a dashboard.  Next up will be feature engineering; a yeo-johnson transformation will be done to normalize features.  Finally, classic machine learning models will be compared using model performance metrics.  The objective of  this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will subscribe to the bank product or not.
